        <h3>Cioppino is an Italian-American Fish Stew Originating in San Francisco</h3>

        <p>
            Cioppino is traditionally made from the catch of the day, 
            which in San Francisco is typically a combination of Dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels and fish,
            all sourced from the ocean, in this case the Pacific. 
            The seafood is then combined with fresh tomatoes in a wine sauce. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The dish can be served with toasted bread, either local sourdough or French bread. 
            The bread acts as a starch, similar to a pasta, and is dipped into the sauce.
